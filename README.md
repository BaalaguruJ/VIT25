Smart Farming SLAMbot Project ðŸšœðŸ¤–
A full-stack smart farming solution developed for the Synthetix Hackathon at VIT Chennai. We built an innovative system using a SLAM-based fleet of autonomous rovers for real-time agricultural monitoring and soil analysis.This project strengthened our skills in robotics, simulation, and web development under tight deadlines.

Project Overview

Real-time web dashboard for rover fleet supervision
3D rover simulation with Webots for navigation and obstacle avoidance
REST API for session-based soil data monitoring
Sensor analytics: soil moisture, temperature, crop health
Fail-safe mechanisms for sensor failures and network issues

Tech Stack

Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Simulation: Webots
Robotics: SLAM navigation
